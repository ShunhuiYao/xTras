INSTALLATION NOTES FOR THE xTras PACKAGE
****************************************

xTras consists of a single package file, "xTras.m". Besides the package
there is documentation available in the notebook "xTrasDoc.nb". This notebook
does not need to be copied somewhere.
The file "xTras.m" must be copied to the directory where you've installed xAct.
This location is most likely the following on the respective operating systems:

Linux:
   - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):
        /usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/
   - single-user installation:
        $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications/xAct/

Mac OS:
   - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):
        /Library/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/
   - single-user installation:
        /Users/<user>/Library/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/

MSWindows:
   - system-wide installation:
        C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application data\Mathematica\Applications\xAct\
   - single-user installation:
        C:\Documents and settings\<user>\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\xAct\

Beware that in Windows these directories might be hidden!
Then the package can be loaded using unix style

        <<xAct/xTras.m

or Mathematica style

        <<xAct`xTras`

Note that some functionality of xTras requires the presence of the Invar database.
This database can be downloaded from www.xact.es.
