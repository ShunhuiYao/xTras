xTras
=====

xTras is a field-theory inspired add-on package for [xAct](http://www.xact.es/), the state-of-the-art tensor
calculus package for Mathematica.

Some of the extra functionality it brings is:

* Generating a list of all contractions of a given tensorial expression.
* Generating lists of dimensional dependent identities (e.g. the vanishing of the Weyl tensor in D=3).
* Making any tensorial expression traceless.
* Computing equations of motion of monomials of Riemann tensors.
* Perturbations around AdS spaces.
* Killing vectors.
* Easy access to the database of the Invar package.
* Young symmetrizers and projectors.
* Solving linear systems of tensorial equations, both for constant variables (SolveConstants) 
  and for tensors (SolveTensors).
