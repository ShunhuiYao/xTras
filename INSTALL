**********************************************

xTras consists of multiple packages that either extend existing xAct pacakges, or bring new 
functionality altogether. The directory structure of xTras is

/
  xAct
    xTras
      xCore.m
      xTensor.m
      xPert.m
      Invar.m
      xCoba.m
      Algebra.m
      Combinatorics.m
    xTras.m
  xTrasDoc.nb

The xTras.m package calls the other seven packages in the xTras folder; it does not contain
any new functions. The notebook "xTrasDoc.nb" contains a bit of documentation. It does not 
need to be copied somewhere.
Everything in the xAct subdirectory must be copied to the directory where you've installed xAct.
The xAct folder is most likely the following on the respective operating systems:

Linux:
  - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):
      /usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/
  - single-user installation:
      $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications/xAct/

Mac OS:
  - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):
      /Library/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/
  - single-user installation:
      /Users/<user>/Library/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/

MSWindows:
  - system-wide installation:
      C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application data\Mathematica\Applications\xAct\
  - single-user installation:
      C:\Documents and settings\<user>\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\xAct\

Beware that in Windows these directories might be hidden!
After installation, the package can be loaded using unix style

  <<xAct/xTras.m

or Mathematica style

   <<xAct`xTras`

Note that some functionality of xTras requires the presence of the Invar database.
This database can be downloaded from www.xact.es.
