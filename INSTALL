xTras consists of multiple packages that either extend existing xAct pacakges, or bring new 
functionality altogether. The directory structure of xTras is

/
  INSTALL              (this file)
  CHANGELOG
  xAct
    xTras              (copy this subdirectory entirely into your xAct directory)
      Kernel
        init.m
      xCore.m
      xTensor.m
      xPert.m
      Invar.m
      xCoba.m
      Algebra.m
      Combinatorics.m
    Documentation      (can also be copied into xAct directory; not necessary though)
      English
        xTrasDoc.nb

The init.m file calls the other seven packages in the xTras folder; it does not contain
any new functions. The notebook "xTrasDoc.nb" contains a bit of documentation.
The xTras subdirectory must be copied in its entirety into the directory where you've installed xAct.
The xAct folder is most likely the following on the respective operating systems:

Linux:
  - system-wide installation (requires root privileges):
      /usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/
  - single-user installation:
      $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications/xAct/

Mac OS:
  - system-wide installation (requires root privileges):
      /Library/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/
  - single-user installation:
      /Users/<user>/Library/Mathematica/Applications/xAct/

MSWindows:
  - system-wide installation:
      C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application data\Mathematica\Applications\xAct\
  - single-user installation:
      C:\Documents and settings\<user>\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\xAct\

Beware that in Windows these directories might be hidden!
After installation, the package can be loaded with

   <<xAct`xTras`

Note that some functionality of xTras requires the presence of the Invar database.
This database can be downloaded from www.xact.es.
